Modified electronics/software to use internal pull-up resistors for Rotary Encoder, eliminating the external pull-up resistors and debounce capacitors.  Used Arduino pins for the 5V and GND of the push-button and rotary encoder, so that all components could be connected directly to the Arduino, eliminating the need for a separate breadboard.
